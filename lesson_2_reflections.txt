What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you init a repository, it creates the hidden .git file that prepares git 
to receive commits. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use the staging area to fill with the files that align to a logical commit,
commit them together with one comment, then fill the staging area with any other logically
connected files, ad infinitum.
